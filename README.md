# DreamHouse2025

# Yo!

Welcome, Python, to your very own DreamHousePython2025!

## Yo! Yo!

- from VCS, navigate to the DreamHousePython2025 repo on your laptop
- Go to the src folder.
- In your terminal, cd to src directory
- Run the main.py with python
    python3 main.py
  - If you get an error indicating you don't have TKinter installed:
    brew install python-tk
- see the dull, dull, window of the sad, sad DreamHouse
- now you need to change the **Picture.py** class
- Re-run main.py to see your changes
- Profit!
